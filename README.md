# What is Java ?
 Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It was designed to be platform-independent and follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java a versatile and widely used language for developing various types of software, from web applications to mobile applications and enterprise systems.
